/*
Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).

For bonus points, write a function groupBy that abstracts the grouping operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a function that computes the group for an element in the array and returns an object that maps group names to arrays of group members.
